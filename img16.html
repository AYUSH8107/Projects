                In traditional Pomo Society, decorated baskets were produced for life events literally from the cradle to the grave. Using individual development over time as your framework, identify some of the occasions for making and giving these baskets across the life cycle. Include both common uses and uses more specific to chiefs and leaders. Pomo baskets are made with many varied materials, designs, and details. The materials used for these individually unique baskets are harvested each year. Fibers from redbud, willow shoots, black ash, sedge roots, saguaro cacti, and swamp canes were used to weave the baskets. Other natural source materials were used in creating a wide variety of distinctive characteristics on these colorful baskets. Many different shells and animal feathers or quills etc., were collected and incorporated into these baskets.
