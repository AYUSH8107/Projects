                A traditional telephone depends on wires to send sound. It has a handset and a base that are connected by a cord. The handset is the part that a person holds to make or answer a call. One end of the handset has a microphone for talking. The other end has a small loudspeaker for listening. The base connects the telephone to an electric current through a wire.

When the caller speaks into a telephone, the microphone changes the sound of the person’s voice into an electric signal. The base sends out the signal through its wire. How the signal travels from there depends on where the call is going. It can remain an electric current, passing through wires and cables. It can travel through thin glass fibers in the form of light. This way of sending information is called fiber optics. Or the signal can be changed into radio waves and sent through the air by antennas and satellites. When the signal reaches the telephone at the other end, its loudspeaker changes it back into the sound of the caller’s voice.
