                Today it seems as if being thin is the only way to go. There is a wealth of businesses that depend upon the American desire to be thin to survive. Exercise and diet companies are a perfect example. In order to create a market for their product they attempt to make women feel imperfect about their own bodies through advertisement. Advertisers manipulate women into thinking their value is dependent on their physical appearance. An overweight person is seen as lazy. Women, especially, are told that their efforts to exercise and to stay fit will be rewarded by success in their personal and professional lives. If they fail at the idea they are encouraged to try harder. The cruel thing is that the social requirement that we achieve the "ideal weight" is based on the presumption that we can completely control our body size, which is not true.
