                The history of the strawberry goes back as far the Romans or maybe as far as the Greeks. In the thirteenth century, the first record of the strawberry was its use as a medicinal herb. It was thought to be good for digestive upset or the curing of gout. A short time later, it was pronounced that the strawberry was unfit to eat due to the fact that they grew close to the ground and therefore the fruit was contaminated. This caused many to avoid the fruit and decreased it's popularity (see www "A Lesson in Strawberry History" ). Back during this time and the few centuries following, not only the strawberry but also many other plants were used in means of helping with the health and welfare of people. By the fifteen hundreds the cultivation of the strawberry was back underway and it had regained some of its popularity. Scientists and physicians had discovered the supposed medical uses and they then began to name many different species ( Darrow 17). By the end of the century three species had been cited, F. vesca, the common garden strawberry, F. moschata, the musk strawberry and F. viridis, the green strawberry (Darrow 19).
