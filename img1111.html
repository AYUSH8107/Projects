                Now let’s go back in time and see how, why, and when was jeans invented. Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis are known for inventing jeans in 1873 (Wikipedia contributors). As we all know, Levi Strauss is famous for his clothing business called “Levi Jeans”. Levi jeans’ jeans are made from a fabric called denim. He thought of the idea of inventing strong pants for the gold miners in California during the gold rush. He wanted to create jeans for the labor class when he started. It all started in Europe when Levi heard about a fabric called dungaree when he saw Italian navy wear that fabric. He found out that this fabric came from India. He liked the fact that this fabric was washed and dried quickly. Also, this fabric makes the cloth strong and durable.
