                Being able to capture a moment forever is a beautiful gift. The ability to freeze great moments in the form of photographs using such a tool gives us power. With that being said, cameras definitely play an important role in our daily life. In today’s generation, we usually use our camera phone to take pictures. It’s the fastest way to take a picture and the easiest, but it wasn’t always like that. When cameras were first invented there was a lot more to it and cameras didn’t have the same advanced technology we have today. Technology today is very advanced and if we take a moment to think about it, it will get more advanced in the future. Cameras today have a great quality and many awesome features.
