                Lipstick is an essential to most women when it comes to appearance because it simply adds the extra visually appealing factor. Lipstick is also used to moisturize the lips, keeping them soft and reducing dryness. Little do most women know about the toxics in the cosmetic because then the cosmetic would be avoided by some if not most. According to pamf.org, a teenager uses 15-25 cosmetics in a day.
                Lipstick is one of the cosmetics that have very harsh chemicals. The common ingredients found in most lipsticks are wax (beeswax, candelilla wax, or camauba wax), oil (mineral, lanolin, castor, or vegetable oil), preservatives and antioxidants, pigment, and fragrance. All of these common ingredients in lipstick have the effect of making the product rich and effective. These are the ingredients most people know are in the lipstick because they are included in most of the labels.
